        last month, is set to join the Spanish giants as a free agent. According
        to The Athletic, Real Madrid is expected to make the official
        announcement of Mbappe's signing this week, ahead of the European

        Jude Bellingham's transfer to Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 was one
        of the most high-profile moves in recent football history. The young
        English midfielder joined from Borussia Dortmund for a fee reported to
        be around €100 million, reflecting his immense talent and potential.
        Bellingham's arrival at Real Madrid significantly bolstered the team's
        midfield, bringing youthful energy, versatility, and creativity. His
        presence has contributed to a more dynamic and resilient squad,
        complementing the club's existing talents. The transfer also underscored
        Real Madrid's strategy of investing in young, world-class players to
        secure future success and maintain their competitive edge both
        domestically and in European competitions.
